Welcome to the osl tutorials
============================

The following tutorials illustrate basic usage and analysis that can be done with osl.
For the tutorials we will use the publicly available multimodal dataset (Wakeman & Henson, 2014). 
This dataset contains simultaneous MEG, EEG, (and fMRI) data from 19 subjects (6 sessions each) 
performing a simple visual task. Subject were watching pictures of famous, unfamiliar, and scrambled
faces. They had to indicate whether the picture was symettrical or not.
