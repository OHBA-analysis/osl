Group Analysis of Source-space Data
===================================

In this tutorial, we will perform a group analysis of parcellated source-space task MEG data using the Wakeman-Henson dataset. This is a public dataset consisting of 19 healthy individuals who performed a simple visual perception task. See `Wakeman & Henson (2015) <https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20151>`_ for more details.

We will do this on the raw time courses bandpass filtered between 3-14Hz. In other words, this will tell us about the strength of the visual evoked response band-limited to be from between 3Hz to 14Hz.

The steps are:

1. Downloading the data from OSF
2. Setup file names
3. Coreg, Source reconstruction and parcellation 
4. Epoching
5. First-Level GLM 
6. Group-Level GLM

To run this tutorial you will need to have OSL and FSL installed, with the appropriate paths specified in your environment. See the instructions on the repo/read the docs for how to install these packages. Before running this tutorial, we recommend going through the **Soure reconstruction** and **Statistics (General Linear Modelling)** tutorials first.

1. Downloading the raw data from OSF
************************************

The public Wakeman-Henson dataset provides MaxFiltered data. Note that the full dataset is available on `OpenNeuro <https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000117/versions/1.0.4>`_.

The full dataset contains 19 subjects, each with 6 sessions. To limit the amount of data that we have to handle for the tutorial, we will use only the first 3 sessions from each of the 19 subjects. This data can be downloaded from the OSF project website. 

Let's download the data. Note, to download the dataset you need osfclient installed. This can be installed by excuting the following code in a jupyter notebook cell:

``!pip install osfclient``

Let's now download the data. Note that this will be placed in your current working directory.

# 5. First-level GLM
# ******************
#
# Setup First-level Design Matrix
# -------------------------------
#
# Recall that we have 19 subjects, each with 3 sessions of data. In the experiment there are 9 different types of trials corresponding to 9 different conditions (i.e. different types of visual stimuli) that are presented on a video screen to the subject in the scanner. The 9 different conditions are:
# 
# * FamousFirst
# * FamousImmediate
# * FamousLast
# * UnfamiliarFirst
# * UnfamiliarImmediate
# * UnfamiliarLast
# * ScrambledFirst
# * ScrambledImmediate
# * ScrambledLast
# 
# The *First-Level* analysis corresponds to separately modelling what is happening in the data of each session of each subject. We do this using a "Trial-wise" GLM, because the regressors in the design matrix of the GLM explain the variability over trials.
# 
# Note that we will fit a trial-wise GLM **separately** to each:
# 
# * session
# * parcel
# * time point within trial (or epoch)
# 
# We will now specify the content of the first-level design matrix using the package glmtools.
# 
# Note that we specify 9 regressors, each of which is a categorical regressor that picks out those trials that correspond to each of the 9 different conditions.
# 
# We also specify 2 contrasts:
# 
# * ``Faces_vs_Scrambled`` contrast, which computes the difference in the response between the conditions in which a person's face is presented versus those in which a scrambled face is presented. 
# * ``Visual`` contrast, which computes a contrast that sums over all the 9 different conditions; this therefore corresponds to the average response over all conditions

# 6. Group-level GLM
# ******************
# 
# Group Model
# -----------
#
# We could perform a group analysis by simply computing a group average of the response over all sessions and subjects. However, it is more flexible to use a GLM at the group level too. We do this using a "Session/subject-wise" GLM, because the regressors in the design matrix of the group-level GLM explain the variability over session and subjects.
# 
# Note that typically the same group-level design matrix is fit *separately* to each:
# 
# * first-level contrast
# * parcel
# * timepoint within trial
# 
# We will now setup the group-level design matrix. We basically have one categorical regressor (it contains zeros and ones) for each subject that picks out which sessions belong to that subject. As such, in the visualisation of the design matrix below you will see 19 regressors for the 19 subjects, each indicating with a value of one which sessions belong to that subject.
# 
# We also need to setup contrasts on the regression parameters, to compute the COPEs (contrasts of parameter estimates) we are interested in. 
# 
# Here, we specify a contrast for each subject, which picks out the the regressor for that subject; and we have one contrast that computes a COPE proportional to the average of the response over all subjects (contrast 20 in the visualisation below - although note that this indexes from 1, whereas when we want to select this context in the python code later, it will have an index of 19, because python indexes from 0).

#%%
# **NOTE**: Sign Ambiguity 
# ------------------------
# There is a complication when comparing evoked responses across sessions and parcels (or dipoles, if we were working at the level of dipoles rather than parcels), caused by an ambiguity in the signs of the parcel time courses. In short, due to the way in which we source reconstruct and compute parcel time courses, we can not tell whether or not the values in a particular parcel and session should have their signs flipped. 
# 
# This is a problem, for example, when:
# 
# 1) Pooling effects over sessions/subjects. This is because some sessions/subject may have their parcel time courses flipped one way, and other sessions/subjects their parcel time courses flipped the other way. Without solving this issue, averaging over sessions/subjects would not work.  
# 
# 2) Comparing an effect across parcels. This is because some parcels may have their time courses flipped one way, and other parcels have their time courses flipped the other way. Without solving this issue, spatial maps that show an effect as it changes over parcels might not look sensible.
# 
# A solution we can use to solve this problem, is to rectify (take the absolute value) of the first-level COPE time courses. This has been carried out in the cell above by setting:
# ``rectify = True``
# 
# This means that we will fit the group-level model to the **absolute value** of the first-level COPEs.
#
# Fitting the Group Model
# -----------------------
#
# We can now fit the group-level GLM to the (sessions x parcels x tpts_within_trial) array, *data*, that contains the absolute value of the first-level COPEs. Essentially, the subject-wise, group-level design matrix will be fit separately to the first-level COPEs for every combination of parcels and timepoints-within-trial.

# A time of 0 secs corresponds to when the visual stimulus was presented.

This shows that there is a huge amount of between-session variability in the cope time course, around the group mean over subjects (which is shown as the black line). As a result, the black line does not look very much like a classic evoked response (ERP or ERF)!

# The group mean is again shown as the black line. Each subject's mean cope time course is shown plus/minus one stddev of the session population.
# 
# This shows that the overall between session variability is dominated by between subject variability, particularly in the timing of the peaks. While this issue is ameliorated by the use of the abs(cope), an alternative that helps further with this problem, is to do an analysis on the amplitude of the time course (e.g. computed using a Hilbert or Wavelet transform). Please see the "Group Analysis on Amplitude Source-space Data" tutorial for an example of this.

# Statistics
# ----------
# 
# When we computed the first-level COPEs we subtracted the average baseline COPE value. This means that these baseline-corrected first-level COPEs are be expected to be zero if the activity is the same as the baseline period. This means that we can do a statistical test on the group mean COPE, for which any significant time points correspond to time points where the activity is different to the baseline period.
# 
# We will do a 2-tailed test, which finds where the group mean COPE is significantly larger, or smaller, than zero. 
# 
# We will do this using permutation statistics on just the visual cortex parcel that we have already been looking at. We will also focus on a smaller time window to reduce unnecessarily excessive multiple comparison correction.
