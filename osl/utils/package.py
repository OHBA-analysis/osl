    Notes
    -----
    Calling pytest.main() will result in importing your tests and any modules
    that they import. Due to the caching mechanism of pythonâ€™s import system,
    making subsequent calls to pytest.main() from the same process will not
    reflect changes to those files between the calls. For this reason, making
    multiple calls to pytest.main() from the same process
    (in order to re-run tests, for example) is not recommended.
