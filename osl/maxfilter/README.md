## Dependencies

OHBA Maxfilter mostly runs using standard python libraries. MNE-Python is required to run the `cbu` mode.

## Install

`ohba_maxfilter.py` runs as a standalone script. Download or clone the script onto your computer and run as a command line function.

## Usage

`ohba_maxfilter.py` requires at least 2 positional inputs to run. These are

```
  files                 plain text file containing full paths to files to be
                        processed
  outdir                Path to output directory to save data in
```

For example:

```
python ohba_maxfilter.py input_files.txt /path/to/my/output/dir/
```

will run each fif file in `input_files.txt` through maxfilter with default options and store the outputs in `/path/to/my/output/dir/`

### Customising Options

Maxfilter processing can be customised using command line flags which are (mostly) mapped to the options in Maxfilter itself. For exmaple, we can specify that `autobad` be included by adding the `--autobad` command line flag.

```
python ohba_maxfilter.py input_files.txt /path/to/my/output/dir/ --autobad
```

Similarly, we can include movement compensation and head-position computation by adding their respective options.

```
python ohba_maxfilter.py input_files.txt /path/to/my/output/dir/ --autobad --movecomp --headpos
```

Some options take additional arguments. Here we specify that temporal extension SSS should be applied with a 20 second data buffer (using `--tsss` and `-st 20`) and that two specific channels should be removed from the analysis (`--bads 1722 1723`).

```
python ohba_maxfilter.py input_files.txt /path/to/my/output/dir/ --movecomp --headpos --tsss --st 20 --bads 1722 1723
```

A [complete list of customisation options](#optional-arguments) is included at the bottom of this page.

#### Temporal Extension

The temporal extension can be turned on with the `--tsss` flag, the buffer length and correlation threshold can then be cusomised using the `--st` and `--corr` options. This is slightly different to main maxfilter which only requires you to specify -st to turn on the temporal extension.

This example specifys a temporal extension with a twenty second buffer window and a correlation threshold of 0.9

```
python ohba_maxfilter.py input_files.txt /path/to/my/output/dir/ --movecomp --headpos --tsss --st 20 --corr 0.9
```

#### Position Translation

There are several ways to customised head position translation to align head position between two recordings. One option is to align both scans to the same pre-specified position. This is done by specifying `--trans` to default and providing a head origin co-ordinate. For example:

```
python ohba_maxfilter.py input_files.txt /path/to/my/output/dir/ --trans default --origin 0 0 40 --frame head --force
```

Will move the point 0,0,40 in head space to the device origin and then align the device and head coordinate systems.

We can also align one scan to match the head position of a reference scan. This is done by specifying the path to a reference fif file in the `--trans` option. For example:

```
python ohba_maxfilter.py input_files.txt /path/to/my/output/dir/ --trans /path/to/reference.fif
```

Will align all files with the head position from the `/path/to/reference.fif` file.


### Multistage Options

More complex maxfilter workflows are implemented as specific 'modes'. Two modes are implemented at the moment.

#### Multistage

The multistage maxfilter is selected using `--mode multistage`. This will first run:

1) Maxfilter with limited customisation, no movement compensation and autobad on to identify bad channels. 
2) Maxfilter with full customisation and movement compensation with the specific bad channels from stage 1
3) Optional [position translation](#position-translation) (this requires that the `--trans` options are specified)

#### CBU

The CBU maxfilter processing chain is selected using `--mode cbu`. This will first run:

1) A custom head-origin co-ordinate is estimated from the headshape points with any nose points removed.
2) Maxfilter with limited customisation, no movement compensation and autobad on to identify bad channels. 
3) Maxfilter with full customisation and movement compensation with the specific bad channels from stage 1
4) Position translation to a default head position.

### Optional Arguments

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --maxpath MAXPATH     Path to maxfilter command to use
  --mode MODE           Running mode for maxfilter. Either 'standard' or
                        'multistage'
  --headpos             Output additional head movement parameter file
  --movecomp            Apply movement compensation

  --autobad_dur AUTOBAD_DUR
                        Set autobad on with a specific duration
  --bad BAD [BAD ...]   Set specific channels to bad
  --badlimit BADLIMIT   Set upper limit for number of bad channels to be
                        removed

                        file
