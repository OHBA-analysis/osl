Preprocessing and source reconstruction for CamCAN
--------------------------------------------------

These scripts use oslpy to preprocess and source reconstruct the CamCAN dataset. In these scripts we also setup a dask client to process the data in parallel.

Order to execute:
1. python preprocess.py
2. python source_reconstruct.py
