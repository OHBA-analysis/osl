"""Coregisteration.

The scripts was first run for all subjects (with n_init=1). Then for subjects
whose coregistration looked a bit off we re-run this script just for that
particular subject with a higher n_init.

Note, these scripts do not include/use the nose in the coregistration.
If you want to use the nose you need to change the config to include the nose
and you may not want to call the remove_stray_headshape_points function.
